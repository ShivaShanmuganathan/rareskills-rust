# Week 2 - Solutions
## Exercise 1 - Calculator program

Build your own "Calculator" Rust program with the following restrictions:

- Create a "Calculator" structure with 2 integer members
- The "Calculator" structure should define at least three traits:
    - `AdditiveOperations`
    - `MultiplicativeOperations`
    - `BinaryOperations`
- The "Calculator" allow severals operations on scalars:
    - Addition
    - Substraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - AND
    - OR
    - XOR
- The “Calculator” can be printed through the following line of code `println!("calculator: {}", calculator);`
    - When printing the calculator, the result shows the result for each operation.

## Solution 1 - `calculator.rs`


## Exercise 2 - Code analysis - NEAR Smart contract
Goal: Analyze a smart contract written in Rust for the NEAR blockchain. ⚠️ This is not a security analysis.
Note: Some concepts have not been explained yet, give it your best! 
Expected outputs:
A summary explaining the purpose of this contract (should fit in 5-6 lines)
An in-depth analysis of the contract. Comments should be added to the code snippet to explain the concepts shown in Lecture of Week 2.


## Solution 2

#### Summary

- This smart contract allows users to post messages to the blockchain.
- If users attach at least 0.1 NEAR when posting, their message is marked as premium.
- The contract stores all messages and provides functions to retrieve messages (with pagination) and check the total number of messages.
- It uses NEAR SDK storage features and basic payable function handling for premium recognition.
- The contract includes unit tests to verify message posting and pagination behavior.

```rust
// Import NEAR SDK helpers for (de)serialization
use near_sdk::borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize}; // Borsh is used for fast binary serialization

```

## Exercise 3 - Code analysis - Rust variants

Several languages such as [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) (for Starknet chain) or [Move](https://move-language.github.io/move/) (for [Aptos](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts) and [Sui](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts) chains) are derivated from Rust. Knowing Rust offers a solid basis to understand smart contracts written with these languages.

Goal: Analyze a smart contract written in Cairo. ⚠️ This is not a security analysis.

Expected outputs:

- A summary explaining the purpose of this contract (should fit in 5-6 lines)
- An in-depth analysis of the contract. Comments should be added to the code snippet to explain the concepts shown in Week 2 Lectures.


## Solution 3

### Summary

- Simple vault for deposit/withdraw with ERC-20 integration.
- This smart contract defines a SimpleVault on Starknet where users can deposit ERC-20 tokens and receive shares representing their stake in the vault.
- Users can later withdraw by redeeming shares for the underlying token amount.
- The vault tracks total deposits and each user’s balance using internal mappings.
- It interacts with an external ERC-20 token via the IERC20 interface, using transfer_from to pull tokens in and transfer to pay tokens back on withdrawal.


| Element              | Meaning                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `<TContractState>`   | A generic placeholder for contract state      |
| `self: @TContractState` | Read-only access to that contract’s state |
| `ref self: TContractState` | Mutable access to the state            |

Why are we using `felt252` here?
- The native data type in Cairo is a felt252 = a field element up to 252 bits
- All arithmetic (add, mul, etc.) is done inside this field
- It’s circuit-friendly and ideal for zero-knowledge proofs

The content of this exercise is available at https://github.com/zigtur/vulnerable-NEAR-contract/

- Audit the smart contract written for the NEAR blockchain
- Describe at least 2 issues with high severity. Write a recommendation to fix the code!
- Write one Proof-of-Concept for each issue as a unit test.
    - Always initialize the contract with “admin.near” as AccountId, so that the first token is minted to this user.
    - Write your PoC with Bob as the attacker.

# NEAR Smart Contract Audit Report

## Overview
This audit analyzes a NEAR blockchain smart contract designed for a minimal NFT ownership system. The contract allows users to mint, approve, and transfer tokens identified by IDs. Two high severity vulnerabilities were identified.

---

## High Severity Issues Identified

### 1. Token ID Overflow and Ownership Overwrite

**Description:**
- In the `mint()` function, token IDs are stored by only using the lowest byte of the supply counter: `supply.to_le_bytes()[0]`.
- This limits token IDs to the range 0-255 (`u8`).
- After 256 mints, token IDs wrap around and start reusing IDs from 0, overwriting existing token ownership.

**Impact:**
- Token owners (such as `admin`) can lose ownership of previously minted NFTs.
- An attacker (bob`) can overwrite and steal the NFTs.

**Proof-of-Concept:**
```rust
#[test]
fn exploit_mint_overflow() {
    let bob: AccountId = "bob.near".parse().unwrap();
    set_context(bob.clone());
    let admin: AccountId = "admin.near".parse().unwrap();
    let mut contract = Contract::init(admin.clone());
    assert_eq!(contract.owner_of(0).unwrap(), admin);

    for _ in 0..256 {
        contract.mint();
    }
    assert_eq!(contract.supply, 257);
    assert_eq!(contract.owner_of(0).unwrap(), bob); // Ownership overwritten
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Enforce a maximum supply of 255 tokens.
- Alternatively, properly store the full `u16` supply without truncating to a single byte.
- Check that the token ID is not already minted before inserting.

**Sample Fix:**
```rust
require!(self.supply <= u8::MAX as u16, "Maximum NFT supply reached");
let id = self.supply.to_le_bytes()[0];
require!(self.tokens.get(&id).is_none(), "Token already exists!");
self.tokens.insert(id, env::predecessor_account_id());
```

---

### 2. Approval Not Cleared After Transfer

**Description:**
- When a token is transferred, the contract does not remove the existing approval associated with that token ID.
- This allows previously approved addresses to continue controlling the token after it has been transferred to a new owner.

**Impact:**
- Attackers (`bob`) can exploit old approvals to steal tokens back from new owners.
- This breaks the ownership trust model and results in potential permanent asset loss.

**Proof-of-Concept:**
```rust
#[test]
fn exploit_approval_transfer() {
    let bob: AccountId = "bob.near".parse().unwrap();
    set_context(bob.clone());
    let admin: AccountId = "admin.near".parse().unwrap();
    let mut contract = Contract::init(admin.clone());
    assert_eq!(contract.owner_of(0).unwrap(), admin);

    let id = contract.mint();
    assert_eq!(contract.owner_of(id).unwrap(), bob);

    contract.approve(id, bob.clone());
    contract.transfer(id, admin.clone());
    assert_eq!(contract.owner_of(id).unwrap(), admin);
    assert_eq!(contract.approvals.get(&id).unwrap().clone(), bob); // Still approved

    contract.transfer(id, bob.clone());
    assert_eq!(contract.owner_of(id).unwrap(), bob); // Bob steals it back
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Clear any approvals immediately after transferring a token.

**Sample Fix:**
```rust
self.tokens.insert(id, receiver);
self.approvals.remove(&id); // Clear approval after transfer
```

---

## Conclusion

Both identified issues are categorized as high severity and must be addressed immediately to ensure the security and correctness of the contract. Fixing these vulnerabilities will prevent asset loss, ownership overwrites, and unintended token transfers, aligning the contract behavior with expectations for secure NFT ownership on the NEAR blockchain.

## Summary Table

| Issue | Description | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Token ID Overflow and Ownership Overwrite | Minting >255 NFTs causes ID wrapping and overwrites existing ownership. | High | Enforce max supply or handle full `u16` IDs safely. |
| Approval Not Cleared After Transfer | Old approved delegates can steal tokens post-transfer. | High | Clear approvals immediately after every transfer. |
